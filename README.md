## 🎮 Gameplay Instructions  

🕹️ **Move**: Use the arrow keys ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ to move the player.  
📦 **Push Boxes**: Walk into a box to push it.  
🎯 **Goal**: Push all boxes onto the target spots to **win**!  
🚧 **Don't Get Stuck**: If a box is against a wall or another box, you may not be able to move it!  

---

## 🛠️ Code Breakdown  

🔹 **Rendering:** `draw_level()` displays textures (walls, player, box, target).  
🔹 **Movement Logic:** `move_player()` updates movement & checks if boxes can be pushed.  
🔹 **Win Condition:** `check_win()` verifies if all boxes are on target spots.
